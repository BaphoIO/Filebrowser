# ðŸ“‚ Web File Browser

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/Nan7Bs?referralCode=ySCnWl)

Filebrowser provides a file managing interface within the attached volume and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit your files.

## FileBrowser Features

- Upload, Delete, Rename and Create Files and Folders
- Preview, Edit and Share Files

## Template Features

- Run any Filebrowser version by setting the `FILEBROWSER_VERSION` variable

- Automatically uses attached volume as storage location

- Username & Password is set by service variables

### Caveats

- Railway only allows attaching one volume to a service so the Filebrowser app data had to be stored in the volume too, therefore a `.filebrowser_data` directory is visible, if this is bothersome you can turn on the hide dotfiles feature in Filebrowser's settings

- Setting a password in Filebrowser's settings will not persist across deployments, this is because the password from the `WEB_PASSWORD` variable is used instead on every deployment, in order to keep the login password in sync with what is set in the variable
